# NavigationComponents
Navigation component consists of 3 important parts. Navigation graph (XML file), NavHost, NavController. All of your goals and routes in the application are located in the nav graph. While navigating the application, you indicate to the NavController a certain path in the Navigation graph or the destination you want to go directly to. Then the NavController will show you the appropriate target for the NavHost.
